# Decentralized-voting-system
🗳️ Decentralized Voting System with Ethereum
A blockchain-based voting system built on Ethereum, ensuring transparency, security, and immutability in elections. This system leverages smart contracts to enable fair and tamper-proof voting processes.

🚀 Features
✅ Secure & Transparent Voting using Ethereum Smart Contracts
✅ Decentralized & Tamper-proof System
✅ Voter Authentication using Blockchain
✅ Real-time Vote Counting
✅ Easy Deployment on Ethereum Testnets

⚙️ Tech Stack
Solidity – Smart contract development

Ethereum – Blockchain network

Web3.js / Ethers.js – Interaction with smart contracts

React.js – Frontend for user-friendly voting interface

IPFS (optional) – Storing voter data securely

🔥 How It Works
Smart Contract Deployment – Election setup on Ethereum

Voter Registration – Only authorized voters can participate

Casting Votes – Securely record votes on the blockchain

Vote Counting – Real-time results without central authority

Results Declaration – Immutable and publicly verifiable

📜 Smart Contract Security
The contract ensures:

Only registered voters can vote

One vote per voter

No modifications after voting

🌍 Deployment
Test the system using Remix IDE or deploy it on testnets like Goerli / Sepolia.

📌 Future Enhancements
🔹 Zero-Knowledge Proofs for anonymous voting
🔹 Mobile App Integration
🔹 Multi-chain support (Polygon, Binance Smart Chain)
